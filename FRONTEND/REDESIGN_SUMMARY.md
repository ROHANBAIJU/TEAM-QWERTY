## 🎨 Visual Design Philosophy

### Clarity Over Aesthetics
Every design decision was made with one question in mind: **"Can a person with tremors, visual impairment, and cognitive fog use this confidently?"**

### High-Contrast Everything
- **Dark mode**: Matte black (#0a0c10) with pure white (#ffffff) text
- **Light mode**: Off-white (#f5f5f0) with near-black (#1a1a1a) text
- **Borders**: 3-4px thick for clear separation
- **Shadows**: Deep (6-8px) for depth perception

### Large, Readable Typography
- **Open Sans font**: Specifically chosen for screen clarity
- **18px base**: Comfortable for extended reading
- **Font weights**: 600-900 for all important text
- **Line height**: 1.6 for easy scanning

### Color-Coded Semantic Meaning
- **Green** (#10b981): Success, medication taken, feeling good
- **Blue** (#60a5fa): Information, symptom trends, input actions
- **Yellow** (#fbbf24): Highlights, medication markers, important notes
- **Red** (#ef4444): Alerts, fall events, requires attention
- **Purple** (#a78bfa): Secondary info, notes, activity tracking

- "Assessment due in 72 hours" → "📅 Next check-up in 3 days"
- "Fall event recorded" → "⚠️ Fall detected - stay safe"

### Chart Summaries
Every chart now includes a plain-language summary:

```
📋 Summary: Your symptoms were stable today. 
Peak levels occurred at 6AM and 4PM. 
You're doing well compared to yesterday.
```

**Benefits:**
- No need to interpret lines and dots
- Positive, encouraging language
