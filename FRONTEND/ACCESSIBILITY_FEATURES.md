## 🎨 Design Rationale

### Why Dark Mode Default?
- Reduces eye strain for extended monitoring
- Better for light-sensitive patients
- Lower screen brightness = less hand tremor visibility
- Industry standard for health monitoring apps

### Why Open Sans Font?
- Designed for screen readability
- Clear distinction between similar characters (I, l, 1)
- Maintains legibility at all sizes
- Widely available and performant

### Why 18px Base Size?
- Recommended minimum for users with visual impairments
- Reduces need for browser zoom
- Comfortable for extended reading
- Scales proportionally on all devices

### Why Large Buttons?
- Tremor compensation - easier to hit targets
- Reduces frustration and failed clicks
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Touch-friendly for tablet use

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Visual Testing
1. Test with browser zoom at 150-200%
2. Use color blindness simulators (deuteranopia, protanopia)
3. Verify contrast ratios with WCAG tools
4. Test in bright outdoor lighting

### Motor Testing
1. Test with tremor simulation tools
2. Use only keyboard (no mouse)
3. Test with large touch targets on tablet
4. Verify hover states are visible

### Cognitive Testing
1. Read all text aloud - is it clear?
2. Can a new user understand without training?
3. Is feedback immediate and obvious?
4. Are error states helpful, not scary?
